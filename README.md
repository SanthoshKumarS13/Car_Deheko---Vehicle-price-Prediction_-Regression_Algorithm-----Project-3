****Car Dheko - Vehicle Price Prediction Using Regression Algorithms****

**Overview**

This project is the third capstone project in my Data Science course, focused on building a vehicle price prediction model using regression algorithms. The model aims to accurately predict the prices of used cars based on various features and has been successfully deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application. The application provides a user-friendly interface for both customers and sales representatives, allowing them to input car details and instantly receive an estimated price.

**Skills Gained**
Through this project, I applied and enhanced the following skills:

* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Python Programming
* Machine Learning: Regression Algorithms
* Streamlit for Web App Deployment
  
The model achieved an accuracy of 90%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the chosen approach and methods.

****Project Problem Statement****

**Objective**

As a data scientist at Car Dheko, my goal was to enhance the customer experience and streamline the pricing process using machine learning. The task was to create an accurate and user-friendly Streamlit tool that predicts the prices of used cars based on various features. The final product is an interactive web application designed for seamless use by both customers and sales representatives.

**Project Scope**

Car Dheko provided historical data on used car prices, including various features such as make, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, and other relevant attributes from different cities. The challenge was to develop a robust machine learning model capable of predicting used car prices with high accuracy. This model was then integrated into a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to input specific car details and instantly receive an estimated price.

**Features**

**User Input:** Users can input car features such as make, model, year, fuel type, and more.
**Instant Prediction:** The application provides an immediate price estimate based on the input data.
**Interactive Web Interface:** The Streamlit app is designed to be intuitive and easy to use for both technical and non-technical users.

**Deployment**

The final model was deployed using Streamlit, making it accessible as a web application. This deployment allows users to easily interact with the model and obtain price predictions for various vehicles.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the practical application of data science and machine learning techniques in a real-world scenario. By developing a highly accurate price prediction model of accuracy around 90% and deploying it as an interactive tool, the project successfully meets the objectives set forth and provides a valuable resource for enhancing customer and sales operations at Car Dheko.
